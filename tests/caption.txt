**Dear network,**  

I'll be honestâ€”Iâ€™ve never been a fan of posting on LinkedIn. Something about sitting down to craft the perfect professional update always felt like a chore. But instead of avoiding it, I decided to **automate it**.  

So, I built a bot. ðŸš€ Now, I just upload an image, add a quick description, and AI does the restâ€”**generating a well-structured post and publishing it for me.** No overthinking, no second-guessing, just seamless content creation.  

This project brings together **FastAPI, Streamlit, Deepseek AI, and the LinkedIn API** to make posting effortless. And you guessed it, **this post was made by AI.**  

If you also dislike posting on LinkedIn but want to stay active, feel free to **check out the repo** and give it a try! ðŸ‘‰ [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/daMS2005/linkedinbot)  

Who knows? Maybe this bot will be the reason I finally show up on your feed more often.
